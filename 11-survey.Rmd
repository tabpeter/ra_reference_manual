# Survey data analysis 

The [survey R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html) is the classic tool for this type of analysis. This package has [extensive documentation](https://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/). The author of the package has posted [publicly available notes from a JSM workshop](https://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/survey-jsm-nup.pdf) that includes more theoretical foundations.  

The [srvyr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/srvyr/vignettes/srvyr-vs-survey.html) offers `tidyverse` syntax of the `survey` package functions 
  
A more extensive list of survey analysis tools is compiled [here](https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/statistics/survey-soft/).
