Welcome! 

This is an in-development draft of a reference manual for training new biostatisticians. The objective of this manual is to equip new biostatisticians to produce readable, rigorous, and reproducible results. These 3 "Rs" of excellent biostatistics are emphasized these themes throughout the modules of this work. The author intends for this to be both a resource for training newcomers to biostatistics and a reference for those already working in the field.

Although the main objective pertains to biostatistics/biostatisticians, some principles of this book are applicable to other fields/careers. If this compilation of best practices, suggestions, and references serves to raise the caliber of content output by a single person, then the author will consider her work worthwhile. 


The author, T. K. Peter,  is a master's level biostatistician working at the [University of Iowa College of Dentistry](https://dentistry.uiowa.edu/research/biostatistics-and-computational-biology), and a PhD candidate studying with [Prof. Patrick Breheny](https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/) in the [University of Iowa College of Public Health](https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/).
